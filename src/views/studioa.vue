      <p>Studio isn't biggest in the world, with 55 square meters definitely belongs to smaller ones, but you can bet your pants that in this tiny space, every square centimeter of studio is purposefully thought out to cover needs of the projects and also keep up with the high standard of contemporary recording studios. In acoustically treated live room you can find multiple sets of drums, guitar amps, photography props, or your chill out zone with sofa and trusty old PS1 to hang out with your bandmates while waiting for your singer to finish her vocal lines. </p>

      <p>Moving to the control room, center part of which is the Otari Concept One 32 channel analog mixing console, that was prior owned by Czech radio, Brno to record and mix Czech National Orchestra. This piece of history is connected with Fostex G24s 24channel 1" Reel to reel machine. So the recording process can be fully analog if you prefer to. But the whole rig is hooked to pc server running Pro Tools Studio, industry standard for a digital recording. All this is obtained by Midas analog-digital converters.</p>
